# meteo
Raspberry Pi and Arduino garden sensors project

This project aims to recollect some enviromental data such as: ambient humidity, light and temperature and soil moisture.

## Hardware
For this project I've used the following components:
* 1 x Arduino Diecimila
* 1 x DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor
* 1 x Photocell Light Sensor
* 1 x YL-96 Soil Moisture Sensor
* 2 x 1K Ohm resistors

You can see the circuit in the following image, as well as in the Fritzing file in the repository.
